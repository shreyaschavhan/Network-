- Mnemonic To remember all seven layers: `All People Seem to Need Data Processing`
- OSI model is not a standard or specification; it serves as a functional guideline to troubleshoot networks, and design network protocols, software's and appliances.

## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐬 (𝐏𝐃𝐔𝐬)

- What are protocols?
> - So, protocols are the set of rules which enables communication by exchanging data in structured format.
> - Two most basic functions of protocols are to:
>   - Describe where the data should go (addressing)
>   - Describe how the data should be packaged for transmission (encapsulation)

- At each layer, for two nodes to communicate they must be operating on same protocols.
- What is same layer interaction? Interaction between two nodes on same layer is called as same layer interaction.
- For adjacent layers, it is called as adjacent layer interaction.
- At each layer of data transmission except physical layer, the sending node adds a header to the data payload, forming a chunk of data called as protocol data unit (PDU). And the process is known as encapsulation.

- The receiving node performs a reverse process called as de-encapsulation or decapsulation


## 𝐏𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 (𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 𝟏)

- A node is the term used to describe devices that can communication on a network.
- On a wireless network, the term is called as station.
- Term host is used in TCP/IP networking
- Physical layer is responsible for physically transform data either using cables or wireless using radio transmission.
- Devices operating at physical layers are:
    - Transceivers : it is a part of network interface that sends and receives signals over the network media
    - Repeater : A device that amplifies electronic signal to extend the maximum allowable distance for a media type.
    - Hubs : A multiport repeater.
    - Media Converters : Converts one media signaling type to another.
    - Modems : converts between digital and analog signal transmission

- What is network?
> - Two or more devices connected to each other where they can share information is called as a network.
> - There are two components of a network:
>   - Nodes: Devices connected in a network  
>   - Links: Pathway by which they are connected

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- What is LAN and WAN?
> - Network can be classified into different kind of networks depending on the size:
>   - In a single location : LAN (Local Area Network)
>   - connecting more than one location : WAN (Wide Area Network)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Full form of OSI : `Open System Interconnection`
- Different layers of OSI:
> - All people seem to need data Processing
> - Application layer
> - Presentation layer
> - Session layer
> - Transport layer
> - Network layer
> - Data link layer
> - Physical layer

#### 1 pomodoro done! Summary:
> - I learned network, node and links
> - OSI model full form
> - LAN & WAN
> - Layers of OSI Model

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Why OSI model and why layering?
> - Because it adds structure to the data transmission.
> - For example, when we divide a problem into steps on the basis of their functionality, understanding the problem becomes much easier, similar is the approach of OSI model.
> - troubleshooting becomes much easier when a problem arises and it problem won't be able to affect other layers.

------------------------------------------------------------------

- What is protocol?
> - Protocol is a set of rules which enables communication using structured exchange of data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- What is PDU?
> - PDU stands for Protocol data unit.
> - When we have to transmit the information, we need to pass the data between each layer one by one. During this process, at each layer (except physical layer), the sending device add a header to the data payload in the form of a chunk, this chunk is called as Protocol data unit i.e. PDU. And the process is called as `encapsulation`. The reverse is called as `de-encapsulation` or `decapsulation`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Describe the physical layer?
> - this is the layer at which the data transmission begins
> - Nodes in a computer network is connected using a physical media, this physical media can be cables or it can be wireless, this media is called as physical layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------

- Devices operating in the physical layer:
> - Transceivers
> - Repeater
> - Hubs
> - Media converters
> - Modems

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Describe data link layer:
> - Data link layer facilitates node to node data transmission.
> - Data transmission from one physical device address to another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Connectivity Devices in data link layer:
> - Network adapters or network interface cards (NICs)
> - Bridge
> - Switches
> - Wireless access points (APs)
