- Describe the functions of layers of the OSI Model.
- Describe the functions of layers of the TCP/IP Model.

## 𝐎𝐒𝐈 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥

- Stands for *Open System Interconnection* (OSI) Model
- What is network?
> - Two or more devices interconnected to each other are called as network.
> - Devices connected to each other are called as **nodes.**
> - The pathway by which they are connected is called as **links.**

- Local Area Network (LAN):
> A network in single geographical location is called as Local Area Network/LAN

- Wide Area Network (WAN):
> A network connecting large geographical location is called as Wide Area Network (WAN)

- Mnemonic To remember all seven layers: `All People Seem to Need Data Processing`
- OSI model is not a standard or specification; it serves as a functional guideline to troubleshoot networks, and design network protocols, software's and appliances.

## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐬 (𝐏𝐃𝐔𝐬)

- What are protocols?
> - So, protocols are the set of rules which enables communication by exchanging data in structured format.
> - Two most basic functions of protocols are to:
>   - Describe where the data should go (addressing)
>   - Describe how the data should be packaged for transmission (encapsulation)

- At each layer, for two nodes to communicate they must be operating on same protocols.
- What is same layer interaction? Interaction between two nodes on same layer is called as same layer interaction.
- For adjacent layers, it is called as adjacent layer interaction.
- At each layer of data transmission except physical layer, the sending node adds a header to the data payload, forming a chunk of data called as protocol data unit (PDU). And the process is known as encapsulation.
